# IMPORTANT TODO

* Permission check by service
* Improved use of supervisors. Now when some things fail, they dont come up.
* Internal notifications
* Timeout and singleton on command services
* Restart failed command services
* Can scan for installed plugins checking for static info on them, no check for logged in.

# JUST PENDING
